# SIMD Intrinsics

This repo contains the slides for a small presentation about SIMD intrinsics in C++, which I prepared for a lecture about concurrent programming.

## Build it
1. You need to clone using the `--recursive` switch
2. Just call `latexmk` on the `talk.tex` file

If you don't want to build the slides yourself, you can also download them [here](https://github.com/LukasPietzschmann/SIMD-Intrinsics/files/12775327/talk.pdf).
